# Admin Email Whitelist Configuration

## Overview
The admin panel now has email-based access control. Only whitelisted email addresses can access the admin panel after Google authentication.

## Authorized Admin Emails
The following emails are authorized to access the admin panel:

1. **abirsabirhossain@gmail.com**
2. **toiral.dev@gmail.com**
3. **aminulislam004474@gmail.com**

## How It Works

### 1. Email Whitelist (`/app/src/utils/adminEmails.ts`)
```typescript
export const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'abirsabirhossain@gmail.com',
  'toiral.dev@gmail.com',
  'aminulislam004474@gmail.com'
];
```

### 2. Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" on `/admin/login`
2. Google authentication popup appears
3. After successful Google sign-in, the system checks if the user's email is in the whitelist
4. **If authorized:** User is logged in and redirected to admin panel
5. **If unauthorized:** User is immediately signed out and shown an error message

### 3. Protection Layers

#### Layer 1: AuthContext Validation
- Validates email immediately after Google sign-in
- Signs out unauthorized users automatically
- Throws `UNAUTHORIZED_EMAIL` error for non-whitelisted emails

#### Layer 2: ProtectedRoute Component
- Double-checks email authorization before rendering admin pages
- Redirects to login page if user is not authorized
- Prevents URL-based bypassing of authentication

### 4. Error Messages
- **Unauthorized Access:** "❌ Access Denied: Your email is not authorized for admin access."
- **Other Errors:** "Failed to sign in. Please try again."

## Adding New Admin Emails

To add a new admin email, edit `/app/src/utils/adminEmails.ts`:

```typescript
export const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'abirsabirhossain@gmail.com',
  'toiral.dev@gmail.com',
  'aminulislam004474@gmail.com',
  'newemail@example.com'  // Add new email here
];
```

## Security Features

✅ Email validation happens server-side (Firebase Auth)
✅ Immediate sign-out for unauthorized users
✅ Protected routes prevent direct URL access
✅ Case-insensitive email matching
✅ Whitespace trimming for email comparison
✅ Multi-layer validation (AuthContext + ProtectedRoute)

## Testing

### Test Unauthorized Access:
1. Try to sign in with a non-whitelisted Google account
2. You should see: "❌ Access Denied: Your email is not authorized for admin access."
3. You will be automatically signed out

### Test Authorized Access:
1. Sign in with one of the three whitelisted emails
2. You should be successfully logged in and redirected to `/admin`
3. You can access all admin features

## Files Modified

1. `/app/src/utils/adminEmails.ts` - New file with email whitelist
2. `/app/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added email validation after Google sign-in
3. `/app/src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx` - Enhanced error handling for unauthorized access
4. `/app/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Added email validation layer
